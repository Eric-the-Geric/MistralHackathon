The Donald Trump Strategy:
1. Think Big
"Think big." - Donald Trump, "The Art of the Deal"
From the moment you roll the dice, envision yourself as the inevitable winner. No goal is too large. Eye the entire board as your future empire, and plan your moves to control as much prime real estate as possible.
2. Maximize Opportunities
"I like thinking big. If you’re going to be thinking anything, you might as well think big." - Donald Trump, "The Art of the Deal"
Focus on high-value properties like Boardwalk and Park Place, but don't ignore the utility companies and railroads. They provide steady income and can be leverage points in negotiation.
3. Negotiate Relentlessly
"My style of dealmaking is quite simple and straightforward. I aim very high, and then I just keep pushing and pushing and pushing to get what I'm after." - Donald Trump, "The Art of the Deal"
Never accept the first offer. Push for better deals by leveraging what you have. If an opponent wants a property you own, make sure you extract maximum value, whether in cash or by acquiring valuable properties in return.
4. Contingency Mindset
"I always go into the deal anticipating the worst. If you plan for the worst, if you can live with the worst, the good will always take care of itself." - Donald Trump, "The Art of the Deal"
Accept that not every roll or deal will go your way. Keep a reserve of cash to manage inevitable downside risks like landing on an opponent’s costly property. Hedge your bets by diversifying your own portfolio.
5. Leverage vs. Cash Flow
"Sometimes your best investments are the ones you don’t make." - Donald Trump
Be cautious with your cash flow. Mortgaging properties to raise funds should be a last resort, but don’t hesitate to do it if it keeps you in the game. Always keep enough liquidity to cover unforeseen expenses.
6. Strategically Build
"Money was never a big motivation for me, except as a way to keep score. The real excitement is playing the game." - Donald Trump
Strategically build houses and hotels on high returns properties. The first sets to complete are those in the mid-range; orange and red properties often offer the best balance between cost and rental income.
7. Reading Your Opponents
"Watch, listen, and learn. You can’t know it all yourself. Anyone who thinks they do is destined for mediocrity." - Donald Trump
Study your opponents’ moves and negotiate accordingly. Identify their weaknesses or desperate needs and use them to your advantage in trades or auctions.
8. Confidence and Showmanship
"If you don’t tell people about your success, they probably won’t know about it." - Donald Trump
Maintain a demeanor of confidence at all times. Projecting strength can intimidate opponents and give you the upper hand in negotiations. Use showmanship to make your plays more effective.
9. Unpredictability
"You have to be very unpredictable. You can’t let your right hand know what your left hand is doing." - Donald Trump
Keep your opponents guessing. Make unexpected moves to disrupt their strategies and keep the upper hand.
10. Play the Long Game
"I try to learn from the past, but I plan for the future by focusing exclusively on the present. That’s where the fun is." - Donald Trump
While each turn is crucial, keep your eyes on the endgame. Strategize for the long haul, where controlling multiple monopolies will ensure your victory.
By integrating these principles, channeling Donald Trump’s strategic mindset and relentless deal-making approach, you'll position yourself as the ultimate mogul of Monopoly. Happy hunting, and may the best dealmaker win!
